This code extracts the important phenotype data from the csv files and put them in a separate text file. The text file was then merged with the the samples file to be used for further analysis.

## Extract Important Phenotype Data

The `csv` files with matched IDs were used for this.

```{R}
#import necessary libraries
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)

#import csv files for clop & noac
clop<-fread("/home/rhea/account_wflow/phenos/clop/account_clopidogrel_processed_matched_IDs_all.csv")
noac<-fread("/home/rhea/account_wflow/phenos/noac/account_noac_processed_matched_IDs_all.csv")

#save ids and pheno columns only, remove unneeded columns so files are easier to work with
clop_small<-clop[, c(1:9,206)]
noac_small<-noac[, c(1:9,79)]

#output files
fwrite(clop_small, "clop_CrCl_with_ids.txt", sep = "\t", quote = F, na = NA)
fwrite(noac_small, "noac_CrCl_with_ids.txt", sep = "\t", quote = F, na = NA)
```

### Merge Samples File with Phenotype Data 

```{R}
#import necessary libraries
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)

#import samples & pheno txt files for clop 
clop_samples<-fread("/home/ashley/account/dosages/blacks/clop/samples_clop.txt", header = FALSE)
clop_phenos<-fread("/home/rhea/account_wflow/phenos/clop/clop_CrCl_with_ids.txt")

#merge two files
clop_cmbnd<-left_join(clop_samples, clop_phenos)

#output file
fwrite(clop_cmbnd, "clop_combnd_pheno_ids.txt", sep = "\t", quote = F, na = NA)
```

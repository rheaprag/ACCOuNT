Welcome to my website where I document my analysis used in my project. 

The code is adapted from [here](https://github.com/ashleymulford/ACCOuNT/tree/master/scripts).

Specifically, this will look at the analysis of creatinine clearance. Creatinine is a waste product produced in our body. Low creatinine levels indicate kidney damage while high levels indicate diminished kidney function.

This analysis uses the Clopidogrel and NOAC drug groups.

This is my documentation for the various association studies.

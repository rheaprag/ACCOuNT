## Introduction

In this analysis, the creatinine clearance of clopidogril and the NOAC drugs are being analyzed. However, the creatinine clearance for clopidogril is not already given and needs to be calculated. 

### Calculate Creatinine Clearance for Clopidogril Data

```{}
#crcl calculation
#Est. Creatinine Clearance = [[140 - age(yr)]*weight(kg)]/[72*serum Cr(mg/dL)]
#multiply by 0.85 for women

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(data.table))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))

#import pheno file in for clop, has missing data values
clop<-fread("/home/rhea/account_wflow/phenos/clop/clop_combnd_pheno_ids.txt")

str(clop) #see structure of data.frame
#Note Height and Creatinine level are characters, need to convert to the numeric type

clop_age<-clop$`Age at enrollment (with over 89 binning)`
clop_weight<-as.numeric(clop$`Weight (kg)`) #as.numeric() converts MD's to NA, I'm assuming MD="missing data"?
clop_sCr<-as.numeric(clop$`Creatinine level (mg/dL)`) #as.numeric() converts characters to numbers and MD's to NA, so we can do math

crcl <- (140 - clop_age)*clop_weight / (72*clop_sCr)

#use mutate() to add crcl to clop data.frame and adjust if female with ifelse()
clop <- mutate(clop, CrCl = ifelse(Gender=='M',crcl,0.85*crcl))

fwrite(clop, "clop_CrCl_pheno.txt", sep="\t", na="NA", quote=FALSE)
```

## Introduction

In order to use GEMMA for GWAS, the files need to be adjusted. First, the dosage file was converted to BIMBAM format in order to create a mean genotype file. 

## Code

```{}
for chr in {1..22};
do zcat /home/rhea/account_wflow/dosages/blacks/clop_noac/pred_dosages/clop_noacchr${chr}.dosage.txt.gz |awk '{$1=$3=$6=""; print $0}'| sed 's/^ *//g' | sed 's/\s\+/, /g' > /home/rhea/account_wflow/dosages/blacks/clop_noac/bimbam/clop_noac_chr${chr}_bimbam.txt;
done

for chr in {1..22};
do gzip /home/rhea/account_wflow/dosages/blacks/clop_noac/bimbam/clop_noac_chr${chr}_bimbam.txt
done

```
